# Water Systems Studio

<p align="center"><img src="images/amite/mine_shaded_imagery.png" height="500"></p>

**The Water Systems Studio**
is an introduction to the design and restoration of hydrological systems.
This studio will address the derelict gravel mines on the Amite River
that have straightened the course of the river,
increased erosion and sediment loads,
and heightened flooding downriver.
In this studio you will learn how
the flow of water and topographic form interact.

**Objectives**
* To map and analyze hydrological systems
* To understand how processes and forms interact
* To design processes as well as forms
* To design for disturbed landscapes
