## Site visits

### Kayaking the Amite

On **09/26**
we will rent kayaks from [University Recreation](http://lsuuniversityrec.com/lsuurec/adventure-education/outdoor-gear-rental/)
and kayak along the Amite.
Please come prepared for wet and sunny conditions
with sunscreen, insect repellent, sunglasses, and water.
Consider bringing a camera and a sketchbook in a drybag.
As a class we will check out a Phantom DJI drone
and Ricoh Theta 360 degree cameras from the
[LSU cxC Art+Design Studio](https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/studios/coad/).

### Amite Gravel Mines
On **xx/xx**
we will visit gravel mines and degraded river banks on the Amite River.
You will document the sites with sketches, photography, photospheres, and
imagery and video from drones.
Please bring sketchbooks, DSLR cameras,
a Phantom DJI drone, and Ricoh Theta 360 degree cameras.

### LSU Center for River Studies
On **xx/xx**
we will tour the [LSU Center for River Studies](http://lsu.edu/river/)
and see a physical simulation of sediment transport on
the Lower Mississippi River Physical Model.

## Precedent studies
Prepare a 15 minute presentation on one of the following precedents.
* [The Sand Motor](http://www.dezandmotor.nl/en/home/)
* [Renaturation of the River Aire](http://www.landezine.com/index.php/2016/06/renaturation-of-the-river-aire-geneva/) [Report](http://www.ir.undp.org/content/dam/iran/docs/News/October%202013/UNDP%20holds%20joint%20workshop%20with%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Energy/1%20Introduction%20to%20Rivers%20Renaturation.pdf)
* A case study from Prominski & Stokman's *River. Space. Design.*

## Design projects
All work should be submitted via the course network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes` on Mac.

### Mapping the Amite
You will research and map the history and impact of mining on the river.
Your maps can include text, sectional drawings, 3D visualizations,
charts, and diagrams. They should map phenomena in both time and space.
Be creative.
Based on your research, develop a site selection methodology
and pick site for restoration.
Present your method and site with a map and logic model diagram.
Finally create a digital painting expressing the most important
qualities of your research.

* Digital painting
* Maps
    * Spatiotemporal map of the history of mining along the river
    * Spatiotemporal map of the evolution of the river channel
    * Flood maps with rainfall data
    * Topographic and hydrological maps
    * Sociocultural maps
    * Soil and landcover maps
* Site selection logic model and map

### Modeling the Amite
You will inventory, model, and represent the existing conditions
on your site in 2D and 3D.
You will curate and present the data you collect during site visits.
You will use GIS data and your site inventory
to develop a map or series maps that explore and represent your site.
Then you will you will model water and sediment flows across your site in GIS.
You will also CNC mill a physical model in high density urethane foam
of your site from lidar data.
You will use this model to develop a physical simulation of sediment flow
and landscape evolution to intuitively explore how the site may change.

* Site inventory
    * Photography
    * 360 photospheres and video
    * UAV imagery and video
    * Plant list
    * Soil samples
* Maps
    * Site map(s) with topography, hydrology, landcover, sections, and dimensions
    * Water and sediment flow
* Physical model
* Physical simulation

### Restoring the Amite
You will design a plan to restore a degraded, abandoned mining site
on the Amite River.
Your design should consider and illustrate the process of restoration,
the funding for the project, and the phasing of the project.
Consider the cost of restoration, the cost of maintenance and management,
and sources of income or funding.
Consider its future use as for example
a recreational park for kayaking,
a nature reserve with bird watching,
or a sustainable development.
As a class you will develop a masterplan showing the relationship
between each of your sites.
Individually you will develop a site plan, other design drawings and diagrams,
a conceptual model, and a physical model.

* Masterplan
* Illustrative site plan
* Grading plan
* Section-elevations
* Perspective rendering
* Planting plan and phasing diagram
* Bioengineering details
* Conceptual model
* Physical model and simulation
* Diagram and timeline for implementation
